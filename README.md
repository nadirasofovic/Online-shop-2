# **Online Shop - Version 2 - Final Assignment**

## **Overview**

This project builds upon the previous version of the online store simulation. In this version, we extend the functionality by adding customer credit and favorite categories. These new features allow us to generate additional reports and adjust previous ones. The goal is to improve the eCommerce store by recommending products based on customer credit, sorting customers by credit amount, and utilizing multi-threading for report generation.

## **New Features and Updates**

1. **Customer Class Updates**:
   - Every customer now has two additional pieces of information:
     - `credit` (float): The amount of credit the customer has, similar to a gift card balance.
     - `favorite_category` (string): The category the customer purchases most of their items from.

2. **New Reports**:

   1. **Product Recommendation Report**:
      - For each customer, recommend the most expensive product they can afford using their available credit.
      - This recommendation is based on the customer's credit and the products in the store.

   2. **Top 10 Customers by Credit**:
      - This report displays the top 10 customers sorted by the amount of credit they have. The data is processed using **multi-threading** to improve performance.

3. **Updated Report (TopSellingItemsReport)**:
   - The existing **TopSellingItemsReport** is modified to work with multi-threading for faster report generation. This change enables the system to process large amounts of data more efficiently.
